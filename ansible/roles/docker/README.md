This Ansible role installs and configures Docker CE on Debian‐based hosts by first installing prerequisite packages (apt‐transport‐https, ca‐certificates, curl, gnupg, lsb‐release, python3‐venv), then adding Docker’s official GPG key and setting up the Docker APT repository (using ansible_facts['distribution_release'] to target the correct release), after which it installs the docker‐ce package and ensures the docker service is started and enabled.
